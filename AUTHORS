Tuiter was design and developed by Manoel Lemos (manoel@lemos.net), to provide
basic access to the Twitter API. It was developed for the experimental project
called Tuitersfera Brasil (http://tuitersfera.com.br), an application to
monitor the Twitter usage in Brazil.

Both projects were latter adopted by WebCo Internet (http://webcointernet.com).
